* First Aid
Within Cadets we teach a number of life skills, one of them being St. Johns first aid. We teach this in 3 different levels, first is heartstart, this gives teaches the cadets how to perform CPR. We aim to teach this to cadets within the first 6 months of them being in the Corps. The next level that we teach is Youth First Aid, this level of first aid gives cadets a broader knowledge of first aid and teaches them how to deal and treat bleeds, shock, heart attacks and many other things. The final level of first aid that we teach cadets is activity first aid, this teaches the cadets more in depth first aid, including things such as using an epipen, performing CPR on a baby and primary and secondary check. With each level of first aid the cadet receives a certificate that is fully recognised as a first aid qualification outside of cadets.
