* ATC Flying High
Run by the Squadron's very own CWO Cotton, CPL Tyler. SGT Batty and SGT Bloor, ATC Flying high is a YouTube Channel dedicated to providing informative and fun content for all Cadet forces. This was all created as part of the projects that take place on Squadron, and the Channel has even been shared and Approved by Air Commodore Dawn McCafferty. Having completed this website, The SQN PR Team now hope to produce videos more often.
